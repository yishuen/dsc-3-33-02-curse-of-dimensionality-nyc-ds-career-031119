    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Recently the terms \"Curse of dimensionality\" and \"Dimensionality reduction\"  are becoming very popular in the field of big data analytics in the areas of machine learning and NLP etc. It doesn't take long before a data scientist comes across these problems in real world scenarios. In this lesson, we shall introduce curse of dimensionality, what does it entail and why can be a serious problem as the size of our data grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives \n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the reasons behind the curse of dimensionality\n",
    "- Explain curse of dimensionality using intuitive examples\n",
    "- Describe what is meant by sparsity and how is it related to dimensionality"

    "## What is Curse of Dimensionality ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've so far looked at analyzing different datasets in a variety of contexts. Most of the datasets we dealt with were well manageable in terms of their size (number of examples) and dimensionality (number of features). In this lesson, we will think about extremely high dimensional data. We saw how a straight line becomes a plane as we move from 2-D to 3-D regression. We can't picture measurements higher than three, yet we must be mindful towards the fact that geometry in higher measurements is not quite the same as geometry in 2D or 3D space. Various parts of higher dimensional geometry are very complex and non-intuitive and this is an important aspect of what we call \"The Curse of Dimensionality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an scenario where we have a dataset of different images, each of which belongs to the classes \"cat\" or  \"dog\" as shown in the image below . The analytical task in hand is about classifying the data so our algorithm can understand cats from dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"catdog.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to convert this data into sets of numbers so that our classifier can learn from them. This is analogous to converting text data into a numerical representation with TF/IDF etc. One criteria could be using colors of these images to distinguish between them. A naive descriptor could consist of three numbers to represent the RGB (Red-Green-Blue) colors. A simple decision tree type classifier can induce following rule from dataset:\n",
    "```\n",
    "If 0.4 * R + 0.6 * G + 0.7 * B > 0.5 : \n",
    "    return cat \n",
    "else :\n",
    "    return dog\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can probably tell, image color alone will not be able to successfully discriminate between two classes. We can therefore, think about adding some new features (dimensions) in addition to color. We could decide to add some features that describe the texture of the image. For example, calculating the average edge or gradient intensity in both the X and Y direction. Adding these 2 new features (x, y coordinates) to existing color features, we now have 5 features that could possibly be used for required classification task. Similar We can also add yet more features like color/texture histograms, statistical measures like correlations etc to improve the performance of the classifier. So apparently, what we see here is more features mean better classification. But this is not always the case, After a certain point, extra dimensions will starting hurting the performance as shown in the following figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](dim1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see as dimensionality increases, the classifier's performance increases until an optimal number of features is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Increasing the dimensionality without increasing the number of training samples results in a decrease in classifier performance, mainly due to over-fitting.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we shall develop an intuition for the key point mentioned above. "

    "With above problem scenario, imagine there are infinite number of cats and dogs in the world, but the data we have is quite limited. Let's say we only have 10 images to start with. Our goal would be to train our classifier on these 10 training instances, that can potentially classify all the cats and dogs in the world. Sounds challenging, right !. Let's see how adding dimensions effect the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Space\n",
    "Feature space refers to the n-dimensions where your variables live (not including a target variable, if it is present). The term is used often in ML literature because a task in ML is feature extraction, hence we view all variables as features.\n",
    "\n",

    "So now the data is spread out in the feature space but still, we cant fit a linear classifier as these classes are still not linearly separable (no single line through the space can discriminate between two classes). Maybe things will look better with more features. Let's throw in the average blue color as a third feature. We may see something similar to image below, where we now have a 3d space.\n",

    "Is this data classifiable, in the three-dimensional feature space, we can now find a plane that perfectly separates dogs from cats (Remember, this is just an example. In real world you would need a lot more than this). So a linear combination of the three features can be used to obtain perfect classification results on our training data of 10 images.\n",

    "So we see in this example scenario that __increasing the number of features until perfect classification results are obtained is the best way to train a classifier__, However, earlier we discussed that this is not the case. Confusing right ? Let's try to work through this below\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Density \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- In the 3D case, the 10 samples are spread over a feature space volume of 5x5x5 = 125 unit cubes. Therefore, in the 3D case, the sample density is 10/125 = 0.08 samples/interval.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "If we would keep adding features, our feature space becomes more sparse. Due to this sparsity, it becomes easier to find a separable hyperplane because the likelihood that a training sample lies on the wrong side of the best hyperplane becomes infinitely small when the number of features becomes infinitely large. However, if we project the highly dimensional classification result back to a lower dimensional space, a serious problem associated with this approach arises as shown below:"

    "Above, we have results of 3 feature classification in a 3-D space, projected back to a 2-D space. The data was linearly separable in the 3D, but not in a lower dimensional feature space. Adding the third dimension performs a complicated __non-linear__ classifier in the lower dimensional feature space. As a result, the classifier learns the existence and appearance of 10 instances in great detail, along with exceptions. Because of this, the resulting classifier will most likely fail on real-world data, consisting of an infinite amount of unseen cats and dogs that often do not adhere to these appearances and exceptions."
